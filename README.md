# COVID19-World-Tracker

This is an app I made by following a tutorial from colbyfayock (https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-leaflet). I've altered it so as to create a better UX for users.

The app creates a map that shows the spread of COVID19 around the world via visual and statistical information.

The following is pulled from colbyfayock's README, with the change of my repo instead of his.
